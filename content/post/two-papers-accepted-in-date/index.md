C﻿ongratulations to Bruno Endres Forlin, Nikolaos Alachiotis, Luca Cassano, and Marco Ottavi that our paper "Lightweight Instrumentation for Accurate Performance Monitoring in RTOSes" is accepted by DATE 2024 as an extended abstract!

Due to the limited set of tools available for monitoring performance counters, evaluating performance metrics in embedded systems poses challenges. I﻿n this work, we utilize performance monitoring counters to observe individual user applications within the RTOS environment, which enables comprehensive application monitoring by strategically placing probes at points of inherent system interference, thereby minimizing additional overhead. A pre-calibration of these probes allows for fine-grained measurements within user applications. This results in the elimination of 100% of the overheads for most counters in our test configuration, impacting the context switch by only three additional instructions per monitored counter.
