This special issue calls for high-quality submissions that address dependability aspects in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), including novel theory, methods, analyses, experimental evaluations, tools, and experience reports. It would be important to highlight how to incorporate the fault tolerance at the cost of time and additional computation in real-time systems and how to derive sound guarantees against faults incurred by mobile and dynamic physical environments. Fault-resilient techniques allow limited errors while preserving timeliness are especially welcome.
