The 36th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS 2024) is over. As a publicity chair, I was involved very early in the organization to call for workshops and papers -- "Apologies if you receive multiple copies of this message". I hope this is the last time :D

T﻿his year we have a very nice program: 17 accepted papers out of 62 submissions (acceptance rate 27%), forming 6 technical sessions over the following 4 days. Prior to that, we have a workshop day, where I also chair the 18th OSPERT. For more information about ECRTS 2024 and the papers featured in its program, please refer to [the ECRTS 2024 website](https://www.ecrts.org/).

N﻿ext year we will see each other in Brussels, Belgium!
