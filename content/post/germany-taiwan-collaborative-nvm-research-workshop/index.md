During 07-09.08.2024, I had the opportunity to participate in a research workshop in Germany, hosted by the Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), regarding system designs for non-volatile memory technologies. It was a great chance to reconnect with former colleagues from my previous tenure there, but also new friends travelling from Taiwan. During my visit, I was participated in several break-out discussions to share our recent findings in the field and portray our take-on towards future computing systems and technical challenges. 

The visit concluded wonderfully with a delightful dinner in a beer garden, with several professors, i.e., Prof. Yuan-Hao Chang (Academia Sinica), P﻿rof. Shuo-Han Chen (NYCU), Prof. Yunshan Hsieh (NCKU), Prof. Jian-Jia Chen (TU Dortmund), Prof. Jörg Henkel (KIT).
