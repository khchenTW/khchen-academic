On 11.11.2025, I had the pleasure to visit the Computer Science (CS) Department at **University of Münster**, together with colleagues from UTwente’s CS Department. It was a department-to-department exchange where both sides presented research highlights, explored strategic themes, and identified concrete opportunities to collaborate.

Representing **CAES (Computer Architecture for Embedded Systems)**, I brought four posters covering [RTOS instrumentation](https://sigbed.org/2024/05/27/lightweight-instrumentation-for-accurate-performance-monitoring-in-rtoses/), [neuromorphic computing](https://people.utwente.nl/a.yousefzadeh?tab=contact), [electric vehicle scheduling](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/energy/news/2025/4/281429/leoni-winschermann-wins-2nd-price-poster-award-at-nwo-ict.open-2025), and [hardware security]((https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/caes/research/dependable-computing-systems/)). The poster shown in the picture – **“Lightweight Instrumentation for Accurate Performance Monitoring in RTOSes”** – sparked particularly deep discussions. These conversations opened up several promising collaboration avenues, including:\
• **Joint student projects** on performance monitoring and real-time systems\
• **Cross-lab experiments** on instrumentation behavior across heterogeneous platforms\
• **Potential joint proposals** aligning with both departments’ research strengths

It was inspiring to see how complementary Münster’s expertise is to ours at CAES – from software verification and embedded systems to algorithms and security. I look forward to following up on the ideas we discussed and turning them into concrete collaborations.

A big thank-you to **Prof. Paula Herber** and the entire Münster CS department for hosting us, and to **Marieke Huisman** for leading the UTwente delegation.

Onward to more Twente–Münster joint research! 🚀
