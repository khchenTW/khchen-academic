As the lead of this initiative, I am so proud to announce the successful completion of the one-week doctoral course on Design and Implementation of Real-Time Systems, the first edition ([](https://lnkd.in/gkMuPj-z)https://asci.school/project/asci-a31-design-and-implementation-of-real-time-systems-course/) under the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI). \
\
üéì This course brought together 15 PhD students from various Dutch universities, each engaged in diverse research areas within computer science. I am thrilled to report that the course was well-received, earning a rating of 8.7 out of 10 in the evaluation! Special thanks to Christian Hakert and Kay Heider for their exceptional support in the hands-on exercises, which were highlighted by most of the evaluation feedback.\

üìö Through a blend of rigorous lectures and hands-on exercises, participants gained a robust understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of real-time systems. We were also delighted to have [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABH-khYBkO5h8MfCs0egoDQ3MeIhqkgOFWU)[Bram van der Sanden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bramvdsanden/) and [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAdy1OkBPcuGW23Q1p0SuwJdkKUDktYp7nA)[Kostas Triantafyllidis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kostas-triantafyllidis-435a2635/) from [TNO-ESI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/embedded-systems-innovation-by-tno/) on the final day, shedding light on the complexity of the high-tech equipment domain and the pressing need for innovative model-based engineering methodologies to wrap up the course.\
