Amidst the COVID-19, virtual meetings have become the norm, in various fields, including technical program committee (TPC) gatherings. However, ASP-DAC, a last-long design automation conference, took an approach this year by insisting on physical attendance of every program committee member at the Paper Selection Meeting. Reminiscent of a time long gone. 

I felt sincerely honored to receive an invitation to participate in the TPC meeting of ASP-DAC in Taiwan. The event organization was truly impressive. Having the opportunity to personally interact with experts, from domains, was incredibly enriching.
