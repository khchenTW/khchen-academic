Due to Covid, virtual meeting have become a new norm, which is also applicable to the technical program committee (TPC) meeting. Hï»¿owever, ASP-DAC, as one of the last long design automation conferences, this year requires that every program committee member physically attend the Paper Selection Meeting -- like in the good old days.

I felt honored to be invited to participate in the TPC meeting of ASP-DAC in Taiwan. The organization is really amazing, and it is good to meet different domain experts in person.
