Honorably, I am a co-chair with Qing Wang and Nirvana Meratnia this year. This year the conference will take place during 27-29 June 2023 in Kontakt der Kontinenten, the Netherlands. We will invite four keynote speakers to share their precious experience, and arrange an exciting program, including an interactive panel.\
