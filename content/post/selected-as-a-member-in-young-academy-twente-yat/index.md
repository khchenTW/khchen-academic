### KUAN-HSUN CHEN (EEMCS)

How can we create future-proof computing systems that serve as the backbone of modern society while maximizing their resilience against environmental uncertainties? As a computer scientist, [Kuan-Hsun Chen](https://people.utwente.nl/k.h.chen) is dedicated to advancing cyber-physical systems, which continuously interact with the physical world in numerous safety-critical scenarios. These systems must not only deliver correct functionalities but also ensure timely performance to prevent catastrophic failures. By prioritizing predictability and reliability, he explores efficient mapping solutions that meet all non-functional constraints imposed by underlying hardware platforms. His pioneering research lies at the intersection of computer science and electrical engineering, driven by his conviction that synergy between software and hardware is key to creating such systems.
