I﻿ am delighted to share that our educational demo, namely "TEACH: Transferable RTOS Education with Accessible MicroController Hardware" has been accepted to appear at RTSS 2024!

Special thanks to Kay Heider and Christian Hakert. They develop a dedicated platform to facilitate the teaching of real-time operating systems (RTOS), featuring sufficient functionality to create interesting and motivating applications and use cases.
