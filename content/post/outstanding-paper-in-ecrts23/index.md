Delighted to share that our paper "On the Equivalence of Maximum Reaction Time and Maximum Data Age for Cause-Effect Chains" has been selected as one of the outstanding papers in the prestigious conference for real-time systems ECRTS this year!\
\
In this groundbreaking work, we show that two well-known metrics (i.e., maximum reaction time and maximum data age), describing the end-to-end data propagation delay, are equivalent!\
\
This remarkable observation holds for almost any scheduling mechanism, and even for tasks which do not adhere to the typical periodic or sporadic task model. This observation is also supported by a simulation of a ROS2 navigation system.\
\
I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to my esteemed colleagues at TU Dortmund University for their invaluable contributions. Together, we have achieved a significant milestone.\
