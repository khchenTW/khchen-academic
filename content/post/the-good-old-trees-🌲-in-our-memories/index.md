On **October 8th, 2025**, I was invited by **Dr. Nikolas Alachiotis** to give a guest lecture in the master course *Embedded Computer Architectures I* (part of the EMSYS program) at the **University of Twente**.

My talk, titled *“The Good Old Trees in Our Memories,”* revisited one of the most enduring models in machine learning — the **decision tree** — and explored how it continues to evolve on modern computing architectures.

During the lecture, we discussed:

* 🌿 **Why trees are still good:** explainability, efficiency, and robustness to noise;
* ⚙️ **System-level insights:** cache, memory, and instruction-level implications of tree inference;
* 💡 **Architectural innovations:** from cache-aware layout optimizations to integer-only inference (*InTreeger*), and further to tree execution on emerging non-volatile racetrack memories.

I also highlighted results from our recent works, including:

* *Efficient Realization of Decision Trees for Real-Time Inference* (TECS 2022)
* *Immediate Split Trees* (ECML PKDD 2022)
* *TreeHouse: An MLIR-based Compilation Flow for Real-Time Tree-based Inference* (TECS 2024)
* *TrackScorer: Skyrmion Logic-in-Memory Accelerator for Tree-based Ranking Models* (DATE 2025)

The key message: **Deep learning is not everything.**\
With architectural awareness, decision-tree ensembles can still deliver **high-performance, explainable, and energy-efficient AI** on embedded and emerging hardware.

Many thanks to **Dr. Nikolas Alachiotis** for the kind invitation and to the EMSYS students for the lively discussion and questions during the session.
