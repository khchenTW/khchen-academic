This year, I had the pleasure of co-chairing the 19th edition of the *Workshop on Operating Systems Platforms for Embedded Real-Time applications (OSPERT)*, alongside Marion Sudvarg (Washington University in St. Louis).

Since its inception in 2005, OSPERT has been a key workshop co-located with ECRTS, serving as a forum for researchers and engineers working with real-time operating systems (RTOSes). The workshop provides a platform to present advances and trends in RTOS technologies, highlight new and ongoing initiatives, and discuss the challenges shaping the future of real-time systems.

Now in its 19th year, OSPERT continues to foster a strong and collaborative community. This year, we were thrilled to receive 16 submissions‚Äîan encouraging sign of the growing engagement in this area. Due to time constraints, we selected 10 contributions to form a full-day program. For the first time, we also introduced a *Best Paper Award*, which was presented to Viktor Reusch for his insightful work, **‚ÄúBounded Resource Reclamation.‚Äù**

A particular highlight was the insightful keynote by Richard West, titled *[Challenges and Experiences Building a Software-Defined Vehicle Management System](https://www.ecrts.org/workshops/ospert25/#keynote)*. In addition to the keynote, the workshop featured a diverse mix of contributions‚Äîranging from practical experience reports to conceptual designs and early-stage research‚Äîall of which sparked valuable and lively discussions.

A heartfelt thank you to our Technical Program Committee for their dedication and insightful reviews:

* Angeliki Kritikakou, University of Rennes, IRISA/INRIA
* Arpan Gujarati, University of British Columbia
* Christian Dietrich, Technische Universit√§t Hamburg
* Dakshina Dasari, Robert Bosch GmbH
* Daniel Casini, Scuola Superiore Sant‚ÄôAnna
* Gedare Bloom, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs
* Junjie Shi, Technische Universit√§t Dortmund
* Marine Sauze-Kadar, CEA-Leti
* Ning Zhang, Washington University in St. Louis
* Peter W√§gemann, FAU Erlangen-N√ºrnberg

Looking ahead, OSPERT 2026 will continuously be chaired by [Marion Baumli Sudvarg](https://www.sudvarg.com/) and Antonio Paolillo (*Vrije Universiteit Brussel*), who has already done a fantastic job this year as ECRTS General Chair. I‚Äôm excited to pass the torch and support them in continuing this tradition.

It‚Äôs been an honor to serve the OSPERT community‚Äîtime for me to step down with gratitude and pride. üòä
