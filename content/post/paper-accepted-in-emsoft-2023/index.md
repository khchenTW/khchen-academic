Congratulations to Mario Günzel, Niklas Ueter, Georg von der Brüggen and Jian-Jia Chen that our paper “Probabilistic Reaction Time Analysis” is accepted by EMSOFT 2023!

U﻿nder the context of end-to-end timing guarantees, current approaches focus on the maximum reaction time, considering the worst-case system behavior. However, in many scenarios, probabilistic guarantees on the reaction time are sufficient. I﻿n this work, we define and analyze probabilistic reaction time for cause-effect chains based on sporadic tasks.
