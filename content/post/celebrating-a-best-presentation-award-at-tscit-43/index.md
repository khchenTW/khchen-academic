I'm excited to share that my bachelor student, **Harald-Mircea Rutsch**, received the **Best Presentation Award** at the **43rd Twente Student Conference on IT (TScIT 43)**! 🏆

Harald’s thesis, *“From Cosmic Rays to Compile Time: LLVM-Based Estimation of Soft Errors,”* tackles a timely challenge at the intersection of compiler technology and system reliability—especially relevant for mission-critical domains like aerospace and embedded systems.

Traditionally, evaluating software susceptibility to soft errors (e.g., bit flips from cosmic radiation) involves time-consuming methods such as fault injection or architectural simulation. Harald explored a different path: *Can we estimate a program’s vulnerability at compile time using static analysis?*

Under the dedicated daily supervision of **Tijmen Smit** (PhD candidate in our group), Harald implemented an **LLVM-based static analysis pass** that offers early, coarse-grained estimates of a program’s Program Vulnerability Factor (PVF). While still a proof-of-concept with limitations—e.g., focused on register-level behavior—it sets the stage for faster, more scalable reliability assessments during development.

What stood out even more was Harald’s clarity and honesty during his presentation, particularly in discussing the scope, contributions, and limitations of his work. The jury and audience alike were impressed—rightfully earning him the Best Presentation Award.

👏 Huge congratulations to Harald, and a big thank you to Tijmen for his great mentorship throughout the project!
