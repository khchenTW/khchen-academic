I’m happy to share that I’ve been invited to serve as a **Co-Chair** for the **Software Architecture, Compilers, and Tool Chains** track at **ICCD 2025**!

The **International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD)** is a well-established venue that brings together researchers and practitioners working on innovative design methodologies for modern computing systems. I look forward to contributing to the program and engaging with the community on the latest advancements in software architectures, compiler optimizations, and toolchain developments.

Looking forward to an exciting conference! More details at [ICCD 2025](https://www.iccd-conf.com/home.html).
