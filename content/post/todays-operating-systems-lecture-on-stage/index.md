Teaching operating systems usually takes place in a lecture hall or a classroom—but today I found myself standing on the stage of **Agora Theater on the campus**, with rows of bright red seats in front of me and full stage lighting above.

It felt almost like preparing for a performance, except instead of rehearsing lines, I was walking through **threads and scheduling** today. The setting gave the lecture a unique atmosphere: students seated as an audience, me delivering “the show” of operating system design.

Today reminded me that teaching is also a kind of performance—one that hopefully inspires curiosity and engagement in the systems running silently behind every computer we use.
