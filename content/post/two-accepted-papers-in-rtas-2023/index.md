I﻿ am very delighted to have our papers "Scheduling Periodic Segmented Self-Suspending Tasks without Timing Anomalies" and "Average Task Execution Time Minimization under (m,k) Soft-Error Constraint" accepted for presentation at [the upcoming 29th IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium](http://2023.rtas.org/).

On the first paper, we eliminate timing anomalies without negative impacts on the *worst-case response time* (WCRT) analysis when scheduling periodic tasks with segmented self-suspension behavior. We propose two treatments, segment release time enforcement and segment priority modification, and prove that both treatments eliminate timing anomalies.

O﻿n the second paper, we propose two dynamic (and adaptive) approaches, i.e., Markov Chain based approach and reinforcement learning-based approach, that allow the scheduler to dynamically select execution modes based on the error-history of the past jobs and the actual error probability. 

T﻿hanks to the DAES group in TU Dortmund, Germany! S﻿ee you in San Antonio, Texas!
