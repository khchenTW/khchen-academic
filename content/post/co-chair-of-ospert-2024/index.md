T﻿his year I am co-chair of 18th annual workshop on the "18th Operating Systems Platforms for Embedded Real-Time applications" (OSPERT), together with Alex Zuepke (TU Munich).

Since 2005, OSPERT is a well-known ECRTS workshop and forum for researchers and engineers working on (and with) Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOSes) to present advances and trends in RTOS technology, to promote new and existing initiatives and projects, and to identify and discuss the challenges that lie ahead. The workshop, now in its 18th year, provides the RTOS community with an opportunity to meet, exchange ideas, network, and discuss future directions. Regrettably, t﻿his year we only received two submissions. For the interest of the communities, we decided to make [a joint day program with RT-AutoSec and RT-Cloud](https://www.ecrts.org/workshops/ospert24/).

N﻿ext year I will chair for OSPERT together with [Marion Baumli Sudvarg](https://www.sudvarg.com/), and hopefully again be a satellite workshop of ECRTS 2025, in Brussels, Belgium.
