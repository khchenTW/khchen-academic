I am an assistant professor (UD1, tenured from May 2022) in the [Computer Architecture for Embedded Systems (CAES) group](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/caes/) at the University of Twente, in the Netherlands. Previously, I was a Postdoc in[ Design Automation for Embedded Systems Group](https://daes.cs.tu-dortmund.de/de) from 2019 to 2021. I earned my PhD in Computer Science between November 2014 and May 2019 in TU Dortmund, Germany. Before my PhD, I received my bachelor and master degrees in "Interdisciplinary Program of Humanities and Social Sciences" (2011) and Computer Science (2013) respectively, from National Tsing-Hua University in Taiwan. I currently serve as [Associate Editor for the IEEE Nanotechnology Magazine](https://inm.ieeenano.org/editorial-board/).

My research interests span a wide spectrum, ranging from intricate algorithms to detailed compilation processes. Particularly, I focus on system software for dependable computing and emerging memory technologies. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am committed to mentorship, engaging in programs such as Google and ESA Space Summer of Code. Furthermore, I am passionate about contributing to open-source development, with a particular emphasis on RTEMS and [Tl2cgen](https://tl2cgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). During my free time, I also provide technical consultancy services to [an indie game design studio](https://da2creative.com/). This multifaceted dedication reflects my enthusiasm for both theoretical exploration and hands-on implementation in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
