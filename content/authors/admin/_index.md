I am a tenured assistant professor in the Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems (CAES) group at the University of Twente (NL). Currently, I serve as an Associate Editor for [the AIMS Applied Computing and Intelligence journal](https://aimspress.com/journal/aci) and Guest Editor for [ACM Transaction on Cyber-Physical Systems](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tcps) and [the Journal of Signal Processing Systems](https://www.springer.com/journal/11265).

My research interest is very broad, from algorithm design down to compilation. Particularly, I like to explore architecture-aware software automation and bridge the gap between theory and practice in real-time system software. Since 2016 I am also a mentor in Google Summer of Code for RTEMS. In case you are interested in the development of open-source RTOS, feel free to contact me.
