I am an assistant professor (tenured) in the [Computer Architecture for Embedded Systems (CAES) group](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/caes/) at the University of Twente (NL). Previously, I was a Postdoc in[ Design Automation for Embedded Systems Group](https://daes.cs.tu-dortmund.de/de) from 2019 to 2021. I did my PhD in Computer Science between November 2014 and May 2019 in TU Dortmund, Germany. Before my PhD, I received my bachelor and master degrees in "Interdisciplinary Program of Humanities and Social Sciences" (2011) and Computer Science (2013) respectively, from National Tsing-Hua University in Taiwan. I currently serve as [Associate Editor for the IEEE Nanotechnology Magazine](https://inm.ieeenano.org/editorial-board/), and Guest Editor for the [ACM Transactions of Cyber-Physical Systems](https://dl.acm.org/pb-assets/static_journal_pages/tcps/pdf/TCPS-SI-Fault-Resilient-Oct31.pdf) and the [ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems](https://dl.acm.org/pb-assets/static_journal_pages/tecs/pdf/ACM-TECS-SI-Memory-Storage-1666297738193.pdf).

My research interests span a wide spectrum, ranging from intricate algorithms to detailed compilation processes. Particularly, I focus on hardware-aware software design automation and practice in real-time system software. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am committed to mentorship, engaging in programs such as Google and ESA Space Summer of Code. Furthermore, I am passionate about contributing to open-source development, with a particular emphasis on RTEMS. This multifaceted dedication reflects my enthusiasm for both theoretical exploration and hands-on implementation in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
