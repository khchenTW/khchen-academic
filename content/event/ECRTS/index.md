title: Technical Talk in ECRTS 2022 

event: 34th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems
event_url: https://www.ecrts.org/

location: Modena, Italy

summary: This talk is about "Unikernel-based real-time virtualization". the research result from the collaboration with TU Dortmund and EMVICORE GmbH.
abstract: 'For cyber-physical systems, real-time virtualization optimizes the hardware utilization by consolidating multiple systems into the same platform, while satisfying the timing constraints of their real-time tasks. This paper considers virtualization based on unikernels, i.e., single address space kernels usually constructed by using library operating systems. We consider deferrable servers in the virtualization platform to schedule the unikernel-based guest operating systems and analyze the worst-case response time of a sporadic real-time task under such a virtualization architecture.'
