abstract: For cyber-physical systems, real-time virtualization optimizes the
  hardware utilization by consolidating multiple systems into the same platform,
  while satisfying the timing constraints of their real-time tasks. This paper
  considers virtualization based on unikernels, i.e., single address space
  kernels usually constructed by using library operating systems. We consider
  deferrable servers in the virtualization platform to schedule the
  unikernel-based guest operating systems and analyze the worst-case response
  time of a sporadic real-time task under such a virtualization architecture.
