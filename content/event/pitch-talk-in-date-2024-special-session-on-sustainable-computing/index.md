title: Pitch Talk in DATE 2024, special session on "sustainable computing"
abstract: >-
  I am delighted to share my perspective from the real-time system designs on
  Sustainability at Design Automation and Test in Europe conference (DATE 2024),
  chaired by Ana-Lucia Varbanescu and Andrea Bartolini in this fantastic city.
  While the whole community have widely worked on energy efficiency over two
  decades, beyond this (e.g. carbon footprint), is rarely explored much. Besides
  ensuring such systems behave in time with all means (so time as the
  constraint), I emphasize to further embrace the timely runtime design (so time
  as the resource) to make the whole systems more sustainable. In this pitch, I
  showcase my recent experience to consider the usage of non-volatile memories
  in real-time systems -- how to turn off the shared memory sustainably but
  safely?
