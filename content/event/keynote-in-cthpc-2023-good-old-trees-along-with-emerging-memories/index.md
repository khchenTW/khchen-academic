title: Keynote in CTHPC 2023 "Good Old Trees along with Emerging Memories"
abstract: In the era of deep-learning, tree-based machine learning models
  continue to be popular in critical domains that require explainability.
  However, several well-known inference libraries still have room for
  improvement. It is surprising that only a few automation tools exist for
  decision tree ensembles, even until very recently. On the other hand, emerging
  non-volatile memories have been widely studied as an alternative to DRAM or
  for building in-memory computing units, which bring up disruptive hardware
  constraints that call for novel maintenance strategies in system software.
  This keynote will offer insights into hardware-aware mapping strategies that
  deliver efficiency and memory lifetime for decision trees and emerging
  memories, as well as their interplay. The talk will conclude with future
  directions from the perspective of compiler techniques and system software to
  follow up on.
