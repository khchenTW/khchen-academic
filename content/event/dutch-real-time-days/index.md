title: Dutch Real-Time Days
abstract: I am happy to co-organize Dutch Real-Time Days event together with
  real-time systems researchers from TU/e and UvA/TNO. The event was funded
  through a 4TU.NIRICT Call Community Funding, where we invited well-established
  European researchers in the area to share their current work and ideas for
  future directions. It is exciting to see that so many nice ideas are coming up
  for our community. A more detailed report and action items will definitely
  come soon!
