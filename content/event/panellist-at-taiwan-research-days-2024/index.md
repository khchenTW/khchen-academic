title: Panellist at Taiwan Research Days 2024
abstract: >-
  It was an honor to be invited by Prof. Ying-Chyi Chou, Science and Technology
  Division Director, to be part of the recent panel discussion on Taiwan-Europe
  cooperation. The conversation delved deep into the collaborative projects that
  span across these two regions, touching on the critical importance of cultural
  exchange, trust, and mutual understanding in driving successful partnerships.


  It was fascinating to hear the perspectives of my fellow panelists and to share my own experiences of fostering partnerships. The emphasis on trust, built through in-person contact and meaningful exchange, resonated deeply with me, as I have seen first-hand how these elements shape successful collaborations, since my postdoc.


  I walked away from the discussion feeling inspired by the possibilities ahead and excited about the future opportunities for deeper Taiwan-Europe cooperation. This experience has reaffirmed my belief in the importance of continuing to cultivate strong, cross-border partnerships that drive innovation and mutual growth.
