title: Seminar Talk in NTUST
abstract: It's my pleasure to be invited by Prof. Chin-Hsien Wu to give a
  seminar talk in NTUST to exchange graduate students, for one of my research
  topic "opportunistic soft-error handling" since 2016. There were several great
  questions, ranging from the research-related topics, e.g., the limitation of
  error model assumed in my work, to general topics, e.g., if UTwente offers PhD
  positions. I look forward to the future of these young talents!
