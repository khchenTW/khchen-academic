abstract: The ubiquity of connected devices and parallel computing platforms
  challenges ef-ficient and reliable execution of machine learning algorithms.
  If machine learningworkloads are executed merely locally, a system does not
  always have sufficient re-sources at its disposal to perform the necessary
  operations fast enough. Furthermore,at a smaller scale, multiple hardware
  components these days are interconnected viaon-chip or off-chip networks to
  create many-core systems. Communication, synchro-nization, and offloading have
  thus become essential in designing embedded systemsunder communication and
  resource constraints.This chapter presents (1) the timing predictability of
  embedded systems and (2) thecommunication architecture in heterogeneous
  CPU/GPU environments. Synchroniza-tion with resource sharing, communication
  with potential failures, and probabilistictiming information are presented in
  Section 8.1. Bandwidth limitations of different exe-cution models and
  coprocessor-accelerated optimization are presented in Section 8.2.
