abstract: With the rapid development of the Internet of Things, machine learning
  applications on edge devices with limited resources face challenges due to
  large data scales and irregular memory access patterns. Non-volatile memory
  (NVM) technologies provide promising solutions by offering larger capacity,
  low leakage power, and data persistence. In this paper, we discuss the
  potential of NVM technology in enhancing machine learning applications by
  improving energy efficiency and reducing latency through in-memory computation
  and different NVM write modes. The insights from this analysis provide
  valuable guidance to device researchers and system architects working to
  develop highperformance systems for machine learning and accelerators in
  large-scale search applications using NVMs.
