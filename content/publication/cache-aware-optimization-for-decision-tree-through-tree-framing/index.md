abstract: Nowadays, the ongoing integration of machine learning models into
  everyday life also demand the evaluation to be extremely fast and in
  real-time. The implementation of the model application must take the
  characteristics of the executing platform into account. Due to" memory wall"
  phenomenon, hierarchical cache memories have been widely used in most modern
  architectures to hide the memory latencies. For such embedded systems, the
  adoption of cache memories becomes really critical. This report briefly go
  through the idea how can we optimize the execution of Decision Trees through
  tree framing approaches.
