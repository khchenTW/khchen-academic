abstract: Future computing platforms are facing a paradigm shift with the
  emerging resistive memory technologies. First, they offer fast memory accesses
  and data persistence in a single large-capacity device deployed on the memory
  bus, blurring the boundary between memory and storage. Second, they enable
  computing-in-memory for neuromorphic computing to mitigate costly data
  movements. Due to the non-ideality of these resistive memory devices at the
  moment, we envision that cross-layer design is essential to bring such a
  system into practice. In this paper, we showcase a few examples to demonstrate
  how cross-layer design can be developed to fully exploit the potential of
  resistive memories and accelerate its adoption for future computing platforms.
