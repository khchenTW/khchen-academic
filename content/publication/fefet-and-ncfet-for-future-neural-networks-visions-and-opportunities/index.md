abstract: "The goal of this special session paper is to introduce and discuss
  different emerging technologies for logic circuitry and memory as well as new
  lightweight architectures for neural networks. We demonstrate how the
  ever-increasing complexity in Artificial Intelligent (AI) applications,
  resulting in an immense increase in the computational power, necessitates
  inevitably employing innovations starting from the underlying devices all the
  way up to the architectures. Two different promising emerging technologies
  will be presented: (i) Negative Capacitance Field-Effect Transistor (NCFET) as
  a new beyond-CMOS technology with advantages for offering low power and/or
  higher accuracy for neural network inference. (ii) Ferroelectric FET (FeFET)
  as a novel non-volatile, area-efficient and ultra-low power memory device. In
  addition, we demonstrate how Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) offer a
  promising alternative for traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) due to its
  lightweight hardware implementation. Finally, we present the challenges from
  combining FeFET-based NVM with NNs and summarize our perspectives for future
  NNs and the vital role that emerging technologies may play."
