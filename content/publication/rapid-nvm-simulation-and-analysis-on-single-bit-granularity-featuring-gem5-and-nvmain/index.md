abstract: In emerging computing systems, non-volatile memory (NVM) is becoming
  an alternative to conventional main memory technologies such as DRAM. With its
  many advantages, it also yields disadvantages, such as shorter memory cell
  life times. Due to this shorter lived nature, wear-leveling on main memory
  becomes an important aspect of systems using NVM. Hardware methods are
  implemented such as iterative write schemes (repeatedly sense and write),
  which will check a memory cell before changing it. But hardware methods alone
  do not provide optimal wear-leveling, so they should be used together with
  software based methods, which try to evenly distribute wear over large memory
  regions. However, for software wear-leveling on NVM main memory, no
  standardized evaluation setup exists. Which leaves most of these approaches
  incomparable to each other. In this work we will leverage existing solutions
  for evaluation such as Gem5 and NVMain and extend them with our own methods,
  analysis setup and benchmark suite. We thoroughly explain our setup in this
  article and provide a tool for a comparable and easy to use evaluation setup
  for software based NVM main memory wear-leveling.
