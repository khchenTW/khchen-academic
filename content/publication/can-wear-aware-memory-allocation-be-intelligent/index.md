abstract: Many non-volatile memories (NVM) suffer from a severe reduced cell
  endurance and therefore require wear-leveling. Heap memory, as one segment,
  which potentially is mapped to a NVM, faces a strong application dependent
  characteristic regarding the amount of memory accesses and allocations. A
  simple deterministic strategy for wear leveling of the heap may suffer when
  the available action space becomes too large. Therefore, we investigate the
  employment of a reinforcement learning agent as a substitute for such a
  strategy in this paper. The agent's objective is to learn a strategy, which is
  optimal with respect to the total memory wear out. We conclude this work with
  an evaluation, where we compare the deterministic strategy with the proposed
  agent. We report that our proposed agent outperforms the simple deterministic
  strategy in several cases. However, we also report further optimization
  potential in the agent design and deployment.
