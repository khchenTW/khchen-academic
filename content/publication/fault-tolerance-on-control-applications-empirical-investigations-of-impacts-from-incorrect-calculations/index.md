abstract: Due to aggressive technology downscaling, mobile and embedded systems
  are susceptible to transient faults in the underlying hardware. Transient
  faults may incur soft-errors or even lead to system failure. A recent study
  has proposed to exploit the concept of the (m,k)-firm real-time task model
  with compensation techniques to manage redundant executions, aiming to
  selectively protect the control application. In this work we provide an
  empirical approach to find the (m,k) robustness requirements. With the
  delivered (m,k) robustness requirements on path tracing and balance control
  tasks, we conduct comprehensive case studies to evaluate the effectiveness of
  the compensation techniques under different fault locations and fault rates.
