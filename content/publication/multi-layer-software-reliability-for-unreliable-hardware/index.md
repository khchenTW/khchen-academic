abstract: This paper presents a multi-layer software reliability approach that
  leverages multiple software layers (e. g., programming language, compiler, and
  operating system) to improve the overall system reliability considering
  unreliable or partly-reliable hardware. We present a comprehensive design flow
  that integrates multiple software layers while accounting for the knowledge
  from lower hardware layers. We show how multiple software layers
  synergistically operate to achieve a high degree of reliability.
