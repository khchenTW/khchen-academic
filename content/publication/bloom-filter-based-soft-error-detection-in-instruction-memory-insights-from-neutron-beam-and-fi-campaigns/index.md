abstract: As memory cells continue to shrink in modern semiconductor
  technologies, radiation-induced Single Event Effects, such as single- and
  multi-bit upsets, pose growing challenges to system reliability. While
  effective and efficient for single and double-bit errors, traditional error
  detection and correction approaches, such as Error Correcting Codes (ECC),
  incur substantial overhead and complexity when designed to detect and correct
  multiple-bit errors. This study investigates the use of probabilistic data
  structures (PDS) as lightweight detectors for multiple-bit soft errors in
  memories. Leveraging the space-efficient and low-latency properties of Bloom
  filters, we implement a lightweight error detector (checker) within a
  representative memory subsystem on a flash-based FPGA. The checkerâ€™s
  performance is validated through extensive neutron beam irradiation and
  fault-injection campaigns, demonstrating effective detection of multiple-bit
  errors with a tunable false-positive rate.
