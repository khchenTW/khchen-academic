abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicle fleets in combination with the
  limited capacities of power grids necessitates coordinated charging
  strategies. To that end, charging schedules are developed that optimize the
  overall power drawn from the grid while ensuring that all vehicles receive
  sufficient energy and technically imposed power limits are respected. Although
  efficient methods for creating charging schedules have been developed, these
  solutions do not account for transparency and uncertainty. Specifically, they
  result in charging schedules that may delay the charging of some vehicles,
  causing low trust from customers and leading to problems if a vehicle has to
  depart unexpectedly early. We tackle this problem by developing charging
  schedules with charging guarantees. For this, we introduce checkpoints at
  which a certain part of the overall energy demand of the vehicle has to be
  charged. This increases both trust from the customers and robustness against
  uncertainty in the departure time. Our solution (called Fulpes) produces a
  provably optimal solution and is based on modelling the problem as a network
  flow with local penalties. A real-world use case with about 250 chargers
  demonstrates the applicability of our approach.
