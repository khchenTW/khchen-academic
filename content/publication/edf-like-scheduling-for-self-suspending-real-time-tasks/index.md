  In real-time systems, schedulability analyses provide the required timing
  guarantees. However, current suspension-aware analyses are limited to
  Task-Level Fixed-Priority (TFP) scheduling or Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF)
  scheduling of constrained-deadline self-suspending task systems. In this work,
  we provide a unifying schedulability analysis for uniprocessor Global EDF-Like
  (GEL) schedulers of arbitrary-deadline task sets. While analyses for EDF-Like
  schedulers are rare, many widely used scheduling algorithms can be considered
  as EDF-Like, for example, EDF, First-In-First-Out (FIFO),
  Earliest-Quasi-Deadline-First (EQDF), and Suspension-Aware EDF (SAEDF).
  Therefore, the provided analysis is applicable to those algorithms. Moreover,
  it can be applied to TFP scheduling as well. Our analysis is the first
  suspension-aware schedulability analysis for arbitrary-deadline sporadic
  real-time task systems under Job-Level Fixed-Priority (JFP) scheduling, such
  as EDF, and the first unifying suspension-aware schedulability analysis
  framework that covers a wide range of scheduling algorithms.

  Through numerical simulations, we show that our analysis improves the state of the art for constrained-deadline EDF scenarios.
