abstract: The increasing availability of heterogeneous ambient sensing systems
  challenges the according information processing systems to analyse and compare
  a variety of different systems in a single scenario. For instance,
  localization of objects can be performed by image processing systems as well
  as by radio based localization. If such systems are utilized to localize the
  same objects, synergy of the outputs is important to enable comparable and
  meaningful analysis. This demo showcases the practical deployment and
  challenges of such an example system.
