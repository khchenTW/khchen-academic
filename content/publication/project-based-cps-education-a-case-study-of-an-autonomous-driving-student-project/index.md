abstract: Competences required for designing cyber-physical systems cannot be
  acquired in classical lecture-based education. This article explains how
  project-based learning enables students to work in teams on problems extending
  beyond their traditional disciplines. The approach can be used as a blueprint
  for project-based teaching of CPS design.
