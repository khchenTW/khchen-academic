abstract: "In many machine learning applications, e.g., tree-based ensembles,
  floating point numbers are extensively utilized due to their expressiveness.
  Even if floating point hardware is present in general computing systems, using
  integer operations instead of floating point operations promises to reduce
  operation overheads and improve the performance. In this paper, we provide
  FLInt, a full precision floating point comparison for random forests, by only
  using integer and logic operations. The usage of FLInt basically boils down to
  a one-by-one replacement of conditions: For instance, a comparison statement
  in C: if(pX [3]<=(float)10.074347) becomes if ((*(((int*) (pX)) +3)) <= ((int)
  (0×41213087))). Experimental evaluation on X86 and ARMv8 desktop and server
  class systems shows that the execution time can be reduced by up to ≈ 30% with
  our novel approach."
