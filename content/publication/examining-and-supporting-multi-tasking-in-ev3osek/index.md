abstract: Lego Mindstorms Robots are a popular platform for graduate level
  researches and college education purposes. As a portation of nxtOSEK, an OSEK
  standard compatible real-time operation system, EV3OSEK inherits the
  advantages of nxtOSEK for experiments on EV3, the latest generation of
  Mindstorms robots. Unfortunately, the current version of EV3OSEK still has
  some serious errors. In this work we address task preemption, a common feature
  desired in every RTOS. We reveal the errors in the current version and propose
  corresponding solutions for EV3OSEK that fix the errors in the IRQ-Handler and
  the task dispatching properly, thus enabling real multi-tasking on EV3OSEK.
  Our verifications show that the current design flaws are solved. Along with
  this work, we suggest that researchers who performed experiments on nxtOSEK
  should carefully examine if the flaws presented in this paper affect their
  results.
