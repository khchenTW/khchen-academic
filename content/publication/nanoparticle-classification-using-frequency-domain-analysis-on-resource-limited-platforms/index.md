abstract: A mobile system that can detect viruses in real time is urgently
  needed, due to the combination of virus emergence and evolution with
  increasing global travel and transport. A biosensor called PAMONO (for Plasmon
  Assisted Microscopy of Nano-sized Objects) represents a viable technology for
  mobile real-time detection of viruses and virus-like particles. It could be
  used for fast and reliable diagnoses in hospitals, airports, the open air, or
  other settings. For analysis of the images provided by the sensor,
  state-of-the-art methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can
  achieve high accuracy. However, such computationally intensive methods may not
  be suitable on most mobile systems. In this work, we propose nanoparticle
  classification approaches based on frequency domain analysis, which are less
  resource-intensive. We observe that on average the classification takes 29 μ s
  per image for the Fourier features and 17 μ s for the Haar wavelet features.
  Although the CNN-based method scores 1–2.5 percentage points higher in
  classification accuracy, it takes 3370 μ s per image on the same platform.
  With these results, we identify and explore the trade-off between resource
  efficiency and classification performance for nanoparticle classification of
  images provided by the PAMONO sensor.
