abstract: We present a method for resource-efficient classification of
  nanoparticles such as viruses in liquid or gas samples by analyzing Surface
  Plasmon Resonance (SPR) images using frequency domain features. The SPR images
  are obtained with the Plasmon Assisted Microscopy Of Nano-sized Objects
  (PAMONO) biosensor, which was developed as a mobile virus and particle
  detector. Convolutional neural network (CNN) solutions are available for the
  given task, but since the mobility of the sensor is an important factor, we
  provide a faster and less resource demanding alternative approach for the use
  in a small virus detection device. The execution time of our approach, which
  can be optimized further using low power hardware such as a digital signal
  processor (DSP), is at least 2:6 times faster than the current CNN solution
  while sacrificing only 1 to 2.5 percent points in accuracy.
