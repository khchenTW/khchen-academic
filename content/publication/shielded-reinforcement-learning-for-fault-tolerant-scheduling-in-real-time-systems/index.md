abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising tool for
  decision-making in various applications, particularly in uncertain
  environments. While its adoption in embedded systems—especially hard real-time
  systems—faces challenges due to stringent timing constraints, integrating
  shielding mechanisms may offer a pathway for RL to optimize its scheduling
  decisions, preserving worst-case timing guarantees. This position paper shows
  a use case where RL selects compliant execution versions for fault-tolerant
  real-time systems while minimizing the system utilization in runtime.
  Furthermore, we discuss possible directions for further exploring RL’s role in
  real-time systems for improved adaptability.
