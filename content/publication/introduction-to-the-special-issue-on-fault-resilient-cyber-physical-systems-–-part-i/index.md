  Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are increasingly pervasive in modern society due
  to their growing use in many complex applications of our everyday life, such
  as autonomous delivery drones and medical robotics. These systems, interacting
  with the environment, are often mission- or safety-critical systems and must
  therefore satisfy strict dependability requirements. Such requirements include
  reliability, maintainability, and availability goals, but also specific
  constraints, including performance, power, energy, or timing. It is arguably
  crucial for safety-critical CPS to provide dependability against faults
  incurred by mobile and dynamic physical environments, which is very
  challenging, especially if fault tolerance is provided at the cost of time and
  computation. Hardware is getting more and more complex and the semiconductor
  scaling is pushing towards the smallest size possible, both with the goal to
  increase the available computational power. These two trends, in addition to
  the employment of emerging technologies, like non-volatile memory, increase
  the reliability threats. Safety-critical hardware struggles to provide
  sufficient computational capabilities to modern applications, which often need
  to resort to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components rather than
  specialized and fault tolerant hardware. Hence, the use of COTS is leading to
  a shift from fault-tolerance to fault-resilience: the hardware is no longer
  considered capable of tolerating any fault, thus modern systems need to be
  designed, at hardware and software levels, in a way that are able to
  self-recover from errors. Novel techniques, solutions, algorithms, and tools
  are thus needed to tackle the design and development of CPS that needs to
  guarantee dependability and safety.


  This special issue offers substantial contributions in several fields, with the goal of improving their resilience against faults. To accommodate the numerous submissions, this special issue is divided into two parts. Part I includes 8 papers published in this issue, while the remaining papers will be featured in Part II, which will appear in a subsequent issue.
