abstract: Due to the growing popularity of the Internet of Things, edge
  computing concept has been widely studied to relieve the load on the original
  cloud and networks while improving the service quality for end-users. To
  simulate such a complex environment involving edge and cloud computing,
  EdgeCloudSim has been widely adopted. However, it suffers from certain
  efficiency and scalability issues due to the ignorance of the deficiency in
  the originally adopted data structures and maintenance strategies.
  Specifically, it generates all events at beginning of the simulation and
  stores unnecessary historical information, both result in unnecessarily high
  complexity for search operations. In this work, by fixing the mismatches on
  the concept of discrete-event simulation, we propose enhancement of
  EdgeCloudSim which improves not only the runtime efficiency of simulation, but
  also the flexibility and scalability. Through extensive experiments with
  statistical methods, we show that the enhancement does not affect the
  expressiveness of simulations while obtaining 2 orders of magnitude speedup,
  especially when the device count is large.
