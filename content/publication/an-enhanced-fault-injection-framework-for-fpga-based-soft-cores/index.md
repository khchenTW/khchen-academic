abstract: Contemporary space system architectures necessitate rigorous
  validation to ensure robust performance post-deployment. Fault injection is a
  critical methodology that improves confidence in these systems by simulating
  errors under controlled conditions. Traditional fault injection approaches,
  such as simulation and emulation, often require costly resources or invasive
  alterations to the Device Under Test (DUT). The FREtZ tool addresses some of
  these challenges by facilitating non-invasive bit flip injections into
  user-bits and Configuration RAM (CRAM) bits via the FPGA's JTAG interface.
  However, its integration with soft-cores remains limited. This paper
  introduces a novel fault injection framework that extends the capabilities of
  the FREtZ tool. Our framework improves both the precision and the efficiency
  of fault injections in soft-core processors by enabling targeted fault
  injections at specific clock cycles or program counter locations. Hence, the
  injection space can be reduced to the DUT, enabling the execution of a
  thorough injection campaign. The proposed method not only refines the
  granularity of the fault injections but also streamlines the emulation
  process, thereby providing a more efficient and less intrusive approach to
  system testing. This advancement represents a significant step forward in
  emulation-based fault injection, particularly for complex space system
  architectures where reliability is paramount.
