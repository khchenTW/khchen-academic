abstract: We present llvmta, an academic WCET analysis tool based on the LLVM
  compiler infrastructure. It aims to enable the evaluation of novel WCET
  analysis approaches in a state-of-the-art analysis framework without dealing
  with the complexity of modeling real-world hardware architectures. We discuss
  the main design decisions and interfaces that allow to implement new analysis
  approaches. Finally, we highlight various existing research projects whose
  evaluation has been enabled by llvmta.
