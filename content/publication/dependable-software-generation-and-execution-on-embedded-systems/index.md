abstract: An overview of the chapter structure and the connection of the
  different sections is illustrated in Fig. 1. Soft error mitigation techniques
  like [17, 29] have shown that the software layer can be employed for enhancing
  the dependability of computing systems. However, to effectively use them,
  their overhead (eg, in terms of power and performance) has to be considered.
  This also includes the option of adapting to different output accuracy
  requirements and inherent resilience against faults of different applications,
  for which appropriate metrics considering information from multiple system
  layers are required. Therefore, we start with a short overview of reliability
  and resilience modeling and estimation approaches, which not only focus on the
  functional correctness (like application reliability and resilience) but also
  consider the timeliness, ie, determining the change of the timing behavior
  according to the run-time dependability, and providing various timing
  guarantees for real-time systems. They are used to evaluate the results of
  different dependable
