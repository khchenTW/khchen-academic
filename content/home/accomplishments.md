    description: The course is designed to provide theoretical and practical insights using a combination of lectures and hand-on labs in which attendees will learn to develop a real-time application on top of a widespread real-time operating system. Throughout the lectures and labs, the students will learn the relation between applications’ timing properties and the underlying system software components. Within the labs, the students will be guided to program a wearable device, e.g., smartwatch, and implement alternative scheduling strategies as well as low-level primitives, resulting in different timing behaviors.
